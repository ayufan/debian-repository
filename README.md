```

### Access

The address of your repositories are:
* https://my-domain.com/orgs/my-org -> organization-wide repository
* https://my-domain.com/my-org/my-repo -> project-only repository

### Evict cache

You can force to evict in-memory request and package cache:
* https://my-domain.com/settings/cache/clear

This is useful to be set as Webhook for project or organization.
